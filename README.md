## Overview


This mod named `edit` allows copying, pasting, filling, deleting, opening and saving 3D areas.
Schematics are loaded and saved from .mts files located in the world sub folder `schems`.

This mod was inspired by the Fill Start and Fill End blocks in Manic Digger.

## Usage

### Copy Tool

![figure.png](figure.png)

When the copy tool is placed at opposite corners of an area, they select the area as show in the figure. The copy tool uses the location under the placed position. When the copy tool is placed for the first time, a marker entity is placed. To cancel the copy operation, punch the entity marker. When a copy tool is placed a second time, the selected area is copied and the entity marker is removed.


### Paste Tool

The paste tool is used for pasting the area copied by the copy tool or a schematic loaded with the open tool. When a paste tool is placed, the copied area or schematic is placed at the corner of the paste tool. The copied area can be rotated by punching while holding the paste tool.


### Fill Tool

The fill tool is used to fill a 3D area with a certain item. Start by placing the fill tool two times at opposite corners of the desired area. The selected area includes the positions of the fill markers themselves as shown in the figure.

Once a second fill marker is placed, a dialog appears listing all items in the players inventory. A search field is also available to search all items. Clicking an item will cause it to be used used for filling the selected area. Clicking on a blank inventory slot will cause the selected area to be filled with air. To cancel the fill, press the "X".


### Replace Tool

The replace tool is used to replace certain nodes in a 3D area with a selected item. Start by placing the replace tool two times at opposite corners of the desired area. The selected area includes the positions of the replace markers themselves as shown in the figure.

Once a second replace marker is placed, a dialog appears listing all node types in the selected area. Check the nodes that should be replaced and then press the "OK" button to proceed with the next step. Next a dialog will pop up showing all the items in the players inventory. A search field is also available to search all items. Clicking an item will cause it to be used used to replace the nodes that were checked earlier. Clicking on a blank inventory slot will cause the checked nodes to be replaced with air. To cancel the replace, press the "X".


### Open Tool

Right click with this tool to load .we or .mts schematics from the world subfolder `schems` for pasting.
Large .we files may fail to load.


### Save Tool

Right click with this tool to save copied area as a .we or .mts schematic in the the world subfolder `schems`.
.mts is the native schematic for Minetest. However it does not support node meta data so some nodes will not be properly saved.
For example, the contents of a chest will be missing.
.we is the WorldEdit format. It supports node meta data but it produces much larger files than .mts.
Large .we files may fail to load.


### Undo Tool

Right click with this tool to undo a world modification like filling or pasting.
Use a second time to redo the undo.
Only the most resent edit operation can be undone.


### Circle Tool

This tool is used to create round structures. Place the tool to activate circle mode. A center point marker is placed wherever the circle tool is placed. In circle mode, any node that is placed will be repeated in a circle around the center point. Node digging is also repeated in the same way. To place or dig a node without it repeating it in a circle, press the aux1 key (E) while placing or digging. To exit circle mode, punch the circle center marker.


### Mirror Tool

This tool is used to mirror the placement or digging of nodes. Place the tool to activate mirror mode. A center point marker is placed wherever the mirror tool is placed. In mirror mode all placed or dig nodes are mirrored. To place or dig a node without mirroring, press the aux1 key (E) while placing or digging. The mirror tool supports four modes, X, Z, X and Z, and eighths. To switch modes, right click the center marker. To exit mirror mode, punch the center marker.


### Screwdriver

This tool is used for rotating nodes that support rotation. Right clicking a node with the screwdriver rotates the node around the X or Z axis depending on the player's position. Left clicking a node with the screwdriver rotates the node clockwise around the Y axis. Param2 types `wallmounted`, `facedir`, and `degrotate` are supported. The node is rotated 90 degrees for all param2 types except `degrotate` where the node is rotated by either 1.5 or 15 degrees. If the aux1 key (E) is held while rotating a `degrotate` node, the rotation angle will be increased by 4x.


## Settings

### edit_paste_preview_max_entities

If the copied area has a larger number of nodes, some nodes will be randomly excluded from the preview.


### edit_max_operation_volume

The maximum volume of any edit operation. Increase to allow larger operations.


### edit_fast_node_fill_threshold

When the fill operation has a larger volume then the specified number, fast node fill will be used.
To disable fast node placement, set the threshold to be equal to the max operation volume.
To disable slow node placement, set the threshold to 0.
With fast node placement, callbacks are not called so some nodes might be broken.


## Privileges

Edit tools and nodes can only be used by players with `edit` privilege.
